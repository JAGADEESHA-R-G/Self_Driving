#### This project is a simulation of Self Driving,
#### built based on Research paper : https://images.nvidia.com/content/tegra/automotive/images/2016/solutions/pdf/end-to-end-dl-using-px.pdf

##  Dataset:
####    Refer : https://github.com/SullyChen/driving-datasets  or https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B-KJCaaF7elleG1RbzVPZWV4Tlk/view

#### I have used Keras functional API for Model Building and Keras Sequence API for Batch Data Generation
#### For Training the model use train.py, And drive_car(run).py for running the model.
#### you can directly run drive_car(run).py without training, if you want to see the results.. testing_model is the model already trained which is used for predicting
